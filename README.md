# Statistical-Learning
Statistical Project (2022/2023)
d'Addario Alessia, Alice Ronzoni

## Problem presentation
In this project we present a binary classification problem based on the  “Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC)”.\
Given a series of observations made on a group of patients and a series of characteristic we were interested in classifying if a given tumor is benign or malignant based on the specific characteristic’s values of every patient’s diagnosis. Our aim was to identify the informative features and use them in several models to study how well those models could classify the two types of Tumor.

## Dataset presentation
The dataset used was created by Dr. William H. Wolberg (General Surgery Dept., University of Wisconsin), Olvi L. Mangasarian (Computer Sciences Dept. University of Wisconsin) and W. Nick Street, (Computer Sciences Dept., University of Wisconsin), who also donated it in 1995. It can be found at the following web page: [uci.edu](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic).\
The data are obtained from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.
